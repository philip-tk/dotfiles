These are my configuration files.
I will go through them to highlight the settings and keybindings that stray from the default.

\section{Zsh}

The shell that I use in my terminal emulator is zsh.
I have enabled vi-mode in zsh.
You can activate it using \texttt{<Esc>}.

I have also enabled extended globbing, which allows me to do things like this:

\begin{center}
\verb|$ rm *~*.txt|
\end{center}

Which removes everything \textbf{except} files ending in ``\texttt{.txt}" .
This is exceptionally helpful when dealing with \LaTeX{} files because the compiler makes all sorts of unnecessary files.
